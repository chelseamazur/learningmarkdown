## Something
### has to change
#### undeniable dilemma 
##### bordem's not a burden
###### anyone should bear

*Constant*
_over-stimulation numbs me_

**But I would not want you**
__any other way__

**It's _not enough_**
## I need more
~~Nothing seems to satisfy~~

###### I said
##### I don't want it
#### I just need it
### To breathe
## To feel
# To know I'm alive

_Finger-deep within the borderline_

_Show me that **you love me** and that **we belong together**_
### Relax
## Turn around and take my hand

*I can*

*help you change*

~~*tired moments*~~ into *__pleasure__*
###### Say the word and we'll be
### well upon our way
###### Blend and balance
#### pain and comfort
#### deep within you
### 'til you will not want me
## any other way

**It's _not enough_**
## I need more
~~Nothing seems to satisfy~~

###### I said
##### I don't want it
#### I just need it
### To breathe
## To feel
# To know I'm alive

*Knuckle-deep inside the borderline*
# This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to
**Relax**

_Slip away_

**Something kinda sad about**

*the way that things have come to be*

*Desensitized to everything*

**What became of ~~subtlety~~?**



###### How can it mean anything to me
##### if I really don't feel anything at all?

# I'll
# keep
# digging
# 'til
# I
# feel
# something



Elbow **deep** inside the borderline

_Show me that **you love me** and that **we belong together**_
#### Shoulder-deep within the borderline
### Relax
## Turn around and take my hand
